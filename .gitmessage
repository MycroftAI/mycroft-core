Commit headline -- not longer than this line (50)

This is the template for commits to mycroft-core and also an example of
a commit message. To use this template, change the first line (think of
it as a "headline" for the commit) and then edit this message with a
longer description of the change.  To be nice, keep lines to 72
characters or less (The first two lines of this template are exactly
that length).  Also use imperative writing, e.g. "Fix broken code" or
"Implement my new feature", not "Fixes the broken code" or
"Implemented my new feature".

Sections below can then be filled out and edited as appropriate.
Unused sections can optionally be removed.

Please fill this out carefully.  This moment is when the code is
clearest in the mind of you, the foremost expert in this change.
Please pause to think of side effects and impacts.
