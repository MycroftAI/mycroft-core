# The purpose of this script is to create a self-
# contained development environment using
# virtualenv for python dependency sandboxing.
# This script will create a virtualenv (using the
# conventions set by virtualenv-wrapper for
# location and naming) and install the requirements
# laid out in requirements.txt, pocketsphinx, and
# pygtk into the virtualenv. Mimic will be
# installed and built from source inside the local
# checkout.
#
# The goal of this script is to create a development
# environment in user space that is fully functional.
# It is expected (and even encouraged) for a developer
# to work on multiple projects concurrently, and a
# good OSS citizen respects that and does not pollute
# a developers workspace with it's own dependencies
# (as much as possible).
