    This class represents a request from a user to control
    an IoT device. It contains all of the information an IoT
    skill should need in order to determine if it can handle
    a user's request. The information is supplied as properties
    on the request. At present, those properties are:

    action (see the Action enum above)
    thing (see the Thing enum above)
    entity
    scene

    The 'action' is mandatory, and will always be not None. The
    other fields may be None.

    The 'entity' is intended to be used for user-defined values
    specific to a skill. For example, in a skill controlling Lights,
    an 'entity' might represent a group of lights. For a smart-lock
    skill, it might represent a specific lock, e.g. 'front door.'

    The 'scene' value is also intended to to be used for user-defined
    values. Skills that extend CommonIotSkill are expected to register
    their own scenes. The controller skill will have the ability to
    trigger multiple skills, so common scene names may trigger many
    skills, for a coherent experience.

    Skills that extend CommonIotSkill will be expected to register
    their own entities. See the documentation in CommonIotSkill for
    more details.

    Skills that want to work with the CommonIoT system should

    The controller registers vocabulary and intents to capture
    IoT related requests. It then emits messages on the messagebus
    that will be picked up by all skills that extend this class.
    Each skill will have the opportunity to declare whether or not
    it can handle the given request. Skills that acknowledge that
    they are capable of handling the request will be considered
    candidates, and after a short timeout, a winner, or winners,
    will be chosen. With this setup, a user can have several IoT
    systems, and control them all without worry that skills will
    step on each other.
