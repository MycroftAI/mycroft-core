    Enum indicating support IoTRequest fields

    This class allows us to extend the request without
    requiring that all existing skills are updated to
    handle the new fields. Skills will simply not respond
    to requests that contain fields they are not aware of.

    CommonIoTSkill subclasses should override
    CommonIoTSkill.supported_request_version to indicate
    their level of support. For backward compatibility,
    the default is V1.

    Note that this is an attempt to avoid false positive
    matches (i.e. prevent skills from reporting that they
    can handle a request that contains fields they don't
    know anything about). To avoid any possibility of
    false negatives, however, skills should always try to
    support the latest version.

    Version to supported fields (provided only for reference - always use the
    latest version available, and account for all fields):

    V1 = {'action', 'thing', 'attribute', 'entity', 'scene'}

class IoTRequest:
    """
    This class represents a request from a user to control
    an IoT device. It contains all of the information an IoT
    skill should need in order to determine if it can handle
    a user's request. The information is supplied as properties
    on the request. At present, those properties are:

    action (see the Action enum)
    thing (see the Thing enum)
    state (see the State enum)
    attribute (see the Attribute enum)
    value
    entity
    scene

    The 'action' is mandatory, and will always be not None. The
    other fields may be None.

    The 'entity' is intended to be used for user-defined values
    specific to a skill. For example, in a skill controlling Lights,
    an 'entity' might represent a group of lights. For a smart-lock
    skill, it might represent a specific lock, e.g. 'front door.'

    The 'scene' value is also intended to to be used for user-defined
    values. Skills that extend CommonIotSkill are expected to register
    their own scenes. The controller skill will have the ability to
    trigger multiple skills, so common scene names may trigger many
    skills, for a coherent experience.

    The 'value' property will be a number value. This is intended to
    be used for requests such as "set the heat to 70 degrees" and
    "set the lights to 50% brightness."

    Skills that extend CommonIotSkill will be expected to register
    their own entities. See the documentation in CommonIotSkill for
    more details.
