    A parametrized factory method returning a global OWM instance that
    represents the desired OWM web API version (or the currently supported one
    if no version number is specified)

    :param API_key: the OWM web API key (``None`` by default)

    :param version: the OWM web API version. Defaults to ``None``, which means
        use the latest web API version
    :type version: str
    :param config_module: the Python path of the configuration module you want
        to provide for instantiating the library. Defaults to ``None``, which
        means use the default configuration values for the web API version
        support you are currently requesting. Please be aware that malformed
        user-defined configuration modules can lead to unwanted behaviour!
    :type config_module: str (eg: 'mypackage.mysubpackage.myconfigmodule')
    :param language: the language in which you want text results to be
        returned. It's a two-characters string, eg: "en", "ru", "it". Defaults
        to: ``None``, which means use the default language.
    :type language: str
    :returns: an instance of a proper *OWM* subclass
