    """Convert a resource into an absolute filename.

    Resource names are in the form: 'filename.ext'

    The system wil look for $XDG_DATA_DIRS/mycroft/res_name first
    (defaults to ~/.local/share/mycroft/res_name), and if not found will
    look at /opt/mycroft/res_name, then finally it will look for res_name
    in the 'mycroft/res' folder of the source code package.

    Example:
    With mycroft running as the user 'bob', if you called
        resolve_resource_file('snd/beep.wav')
    it would return either '/home/bob/.local/share/mycroft/snd/beep.wav' or
