def load_commented_json(filename):
    """ Loads an JSON file, ignoring comments

    Supports a trivial extension to the JSON file format.  Allow comments
    to be embedded within the JSON, requiring that a comment be on an
    independent line starting with '//' or '#'.

    NOTE: A file created with these style comments will break strict JSON
          parsers.  This is similar to but lighter-weight than "human json"
          proposed at https://hjson.org

    Args:
        filename (str):  path to the commented JSON file

    Returns:
        obj: decoded Python object
